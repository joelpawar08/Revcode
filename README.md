# 🚀 Revcode

> **Intelligent Code Generation Powered by RAG & Vector Database**

Transform your code development experience with AI-driven documentation referencing and intelligent code correction. Revcode leverages advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology to provide context-aware code suggestions by referencing your uploaded documentation.

## ✨ What is Revcode?

Revcode is a next-generation code generator that bridges the gap between documentation and implementation. By combining Vector Database technology with intelligent retrieval systems, it provides accurate, context-aware code suggestions and corrections based on your specific documentation and coding standards.

### 🎯 Core Concept

- **Input**: Text descriptions or existing code files
- **Process**: RAG system retrieves relevant documentation from Vector DB
- **Output**: Corrected, optimized, or newly generated code aligned with your documentation standards

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

**Frontend Stack**
- React.js with Vite for lightning-fast development experience
- Modern, responsive user interface

**Backend Infrastructure** 
- FastAPI for high-performance API endpoints
- Node.js for additional backend services
- Docker containerization for seamless deployment

**AI & Data Layer**
- **Weaviate** as Vector Database for efficient semantic search
- **Snowflake Embedding Model** for high-quality vector representations
- **RAG System** for intelligent document retrieval
- **CodeGemma Model** for advanced code generation

## 🌟 Key Features

### 📚 **Documentation-Driven Development**
Upload your code documentation and let Revcode reference it automatically for consistent code generation.

### 🔍 **Intelligent Code Correction**
Submit existing code for review and correction based on your established coding standards and documentation.

### ⚡ **Context-Aware Generation**
Generate new code that aligns perfectly with your project's architecture and documentation patterns.

### 🎯 **Precision Retrieval**
Advanced RAG technology ensures only the most relevant documentation is used for each query.
